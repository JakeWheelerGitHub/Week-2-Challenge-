# Loan Qualifier App / Week 2 Challenge

This is a loan qualifier application. It asks for credit score and loan Size, and calculates debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-value ratio. Using these values the application matches the user with the loans that they qualify for and optionally saves them to a .csv file. This allows users to quickly and easily determine which loans they qualify for.
